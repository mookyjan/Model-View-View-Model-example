 First i have created a new project 
 then i have created three fragments ALL,Men and Women Fragments.
 To show the data in these fragments 
 I have used two methods to show data from json Files
 
 
 
 Ist Method:
 In first method i have uploaded the json File to my github repository  and used it like a Rest APIs to get data from server
 in this approach i have used the mvvm appproach with retrofit to show data from server.
 
 </br>
 
 2nd Method:
 In second method to show these data from assets folder where the josn Files I have kept.

</br>

Create different folders for
API: Which contain API refrence to call the api      </br>
Model:that contain model classes                    </br>
Repository: Business Logic of the App                   </br>
ViewModel: Which is used as a bridge between view and Repository            </br>

Libraries:
Retrofit to get data from server     </br>
GLide to show image in a imageView    </br>
Sdp Library: this library is used to set the app for all screens.</br>
Android Architecture Dependency:          </br>

And with every operation and methods comments are written that what it did.
